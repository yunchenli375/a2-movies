# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you in working hours?

### Estimate

4 hours

### Actual

3 hours

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

PyCharm is satisfying to use. Especially after learning its keyboard shortcuts in editor. Checking the references of a variable or function is very useful, so I can quickly ensure the ongoing modification will not break the feature. The integrated debugger allowed me to step through code execution and identify issues efficiently, particularly when debugging the console program. The code completion and syntax highlighting features helped catch errors early in the development process. Additionally, PyCharm's refactoring tools made it easy to rename variables and methods across the entire project while maintaining consistency. The built-in version control integration also streamlined the process of tracking changes and managing different iterations of the code.
